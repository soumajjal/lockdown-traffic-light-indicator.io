LOCKDOWN TRAFFIC LIGHT INDICATOR (LOT-LIN)

With the advent of 2020 we witnessed various new events in the history of mankind, one of the most used term during this period is “lockdown”, by now we assume we all are familiar with the term lockdown, which is an emergency protocol which restricts the movement of the people in the given area and all the non-essential services remains closed during this period.
Though lockdown was effective up to a certain extent in checking COVID but it had a heavy toll on the economy of the country and followed by loss of job and other scenarios but it would have an saved by using effective methods our idea targets the main motive of effective lockdown planning we will explaining in a more detailed manner inside.
Lockdown traffic light indicator has three basic indicating lights just like the traffic light for easy understanding of the people it has live server which gathers all the data covid data i.e.
1.polulation of the given area
2.no of infected people (admitted in hospitals + in homes or isolation center)
3. no of deaths
From these given data we will get the-
4. infectivity rate
5.fatality rate

Based on these data the place can be indicated by three lights, the user placing the input will be directed to the specific page with the light indicator-
1.	Red light page the user will be directed to this page if and only the infectivity or the death rate is above 1.5% and 0.5% here we will be listing all the guidelines of this area with restriction on movement and on all non-essential services, and precautionary measures and dos and don’ts will be listed.
2.	yellow light page the user will be directed to this page if and only the infectivity or the death rate is above 0.25-1.5% and O.1-0.5% here we will be listing all the guidelines of this area with the steps to enter the green light zone with precautionary measures and dos and don’ts will be listed.
3.	Green light page the user will be directed to this page if and only the infectivity or the death rate is below 0.25% and O.1% here we will be listing all the guidelines of this area and how to convert into a covid free area and with proper vaccination and with maintaining all safety measures where required, here will be absolutely zero movement guideline.
Our main idea of this project is that people by seeing the daily situation can quickly start following the guidelines there will be absolute zero-time gap for action and it solves the effective guideline theme in the easiest way and it generates the the analysis and disseminate the decisions to the public and also provides awareness by constantly focusing on the dos and don’ts
